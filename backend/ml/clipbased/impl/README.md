## About ClipBased Detection

ClipBased is a state-of-the-art method for detecting AI-generated (synthetic) images developed by the GRIP research
group at the University of Naples. The approach leverages OpenCLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models to
distinguish between real and synthetic images.

### Key Concepts

- **OpenCLIP Foundation**: Uses pre-trained OpenCLIP models as feature extractors
- **Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR)**: Statistical scoring method for classification
- **Multi-Modal Understanding**: Leverages vision-language representations
- **Generalization**: Trained to detect various AI generation methods

### Technical Approach

1. **Feature Extraction**: OpenCLIP models extract rich multi-modal features
2. **Statistical Modeling**: Gaussian modeling of real/synthetic feature distributions
3. **LLR Scoring**: Computes likelihood ratios for classification decisions
4. **Threshold-based Detection**: Configurable thresholds for decision making

### Supported Models

- **OpenCLIP ViT-L/14**: Large Vision Transformer with 14x14 patches
- **OpenCLIP ViT-B/32**: Base Vision Transformer with 32x32 patches
- **OpenCLIP EVA02-L/14**: Enhanced Vision Transformer variant
- **Custom Architectures**: ResNet-based alternatives for comparison

### Detection Capabilities

- **GAN-generated Images**: StyleGAN, ProGAN, BigGAN, etc.
- **Diffusion Models**: Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney outputs
- **Commercial Tools**: Images from various AI art generators
- **Cross-dataset Generalization**: Robust across different synthetic datasets

### Research Impact

- Novel application of CLIP for synthetic image detection
- Superior generalization compared to CNN-based methods
- Benchmarked on multiple synthetic image datasets
- Practical applicability for content verification

## Integration in This Repository

### What We've Integrated

We have fully integrated the ClipBased framework for AI-generated image detection:

```
clipbased_detection/
├── models/          # OpenCLIP-based model architectures
├── weights/         # Pre-trained model weights
└── utils/           # Processing and evaluation utilities
```

### Key Components Used

1. **Model Architectures** (`models/`):
    - `openclipnet.py` - OpenCLIP-based detection networks
    - `resnet_mod.py` - Modified ResNet architectures
    - `__init__.py` - Model factory and utilities

2. **Pre-trained Weights** (`weights/`):
    - `Corvi2023/` - Original paper's trained weights
    - `clipdet_latent10k/` - Models trained on Latent Diffusion dataset
    - `clipdet_latent10k_plus/` - Enhanced models with extended training
    - Configuration files for each model variant

3. **Processing Utilities** (`utils/`):
    - `processing.py` - Image preprocessing and feature extraction
    - `fusion.py` - Multi-model fusion strategies

### Integration Enhancements

Beyond the original repository, we've added:

1. **Unified Interface**:
   ```python
   from clipbased_detection import ClipBasedImageDetector
   detector = ClipBasedImageDetector()
   result = detector.detect_image('image.jpg')
   ```

2. **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple images efficiently
3. **URL Support**: Direct detection from image URLs
4. **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of different models
5. **FastAPI Integration**: REST API endpoints for image detection
6. **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model selection

### Model Management

Instead of external dependencies, we now have:

- **Local Weights**: All pre-trained models included in repository
- **Automatic Loading**: Models loaded based on configuration
- **Version Control**: All weights under source control
- **No Runtime Downloads**: Immediate availability without internet

### Configuration Options

```python
# Environment variables for configuration
CLIPBASED_DEFAULT_MODEL = "openclip_vit_l14"  # Model selection
CLIPBASED_THRESHOLD = 0.0                     # Detection threshold
CLIPBASED_BATCH_SIZE = 16                     # Batch processing size
CLIPBASED_DEVICE = "auto"                     # Device selection
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/image/detect` - Single image detection
- `POST /api/v1/image/detect-url` - Detection from URL
- `GET /api/v1/image/models` - Available models list

### Performance Characteristics

- **High Accuracy**: Superior detection rates across various generators
- **Fast Inference**: Optimized for real-time detection
- **Memory Efficient**: Careful resource management
- **Scalable**: Batch processing for production use

### Benefits of Integration

- **Self-Contained**: No external repository dependencies
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new models and capabilities
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive API documentation
- **Tested**: Extensive test coverage for reliability

## Usage Examples

### Basic Detection

```python
from clipbased_detection import ClipBasedImageDetector

detector = ClipBasedImageDetector()
result = detector.detect_image('suspect_image.jpg')
print(f"AI-generated: {result['is_ai_generated']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.3f}")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
results = detector.detect_batch(['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg'])
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Image {i+1}: {result['confidence']:.3f}")
```

### Model Comparison

```python
from slowfast_detection.clipbased_detection import compare_models

comparison = compare_models('image.jpg', ['openclip_vit_l14', 'openclip_vit_b32'])
print(comparison)
```
