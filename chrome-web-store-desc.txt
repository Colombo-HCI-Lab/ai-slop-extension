‚Ä¢ Real-time Detection: Automatically analyzes Facebook posts as you scroll
‚Ä¢ Visual Indicators: Clear icons show detection results (AI-generated vs. Human-created)
‚Ä¢ Non-intrusive: Seamlessly integrates with Facebook's interface
‚Ä¢ Privacy-First: No personal data collection, posts analyzed temporarily only
‚Ä¢ Research Purpose: Developed for academic study of AI content prevalence

üî¨ Research Context:
This extension is developed by the Colombo HCI Lab for academic research purposes to study the prevalence and characteristics of AI-generated content on social media platforms. It's designed to help researchers and users understand how artificial content spreads online.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
1. Install the extension and visit Facebook
2. Browse your feed normally - the extension works automatically
3. Look for detection icons next to posts showing analysis results
4. Post content is analyzed via secure API and results displayed instantly
5. No data is stored permanently - analysis happens in real-time only

‚Ä¢ Zero PII Collection: We don't collect names, emails, or personal information
‚Ä¢ Temporary Analysis: Post content analyzed immediately, not stored
‚Ä¢ Secure Communication: All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption

‚Ä¢ No Tracking: No user profiles, accounts, or behavioral tracking

üéì Perfect For:
‚Ä¢ Researchers studying AI content on social media
‚Ä¢ Social media users curious about content authenticity
‚Ä¢ Digital literacy educators and students
‚Ä¢ Anyone interested in understanding AI's impact on social platforms

üìä Technical Details:
‚Ä¢ Works exclusively on Facebook.com domains
‚Ä¢ Uses advanced natural language processing for detection
‚Ä¢ Minimal performance impact on browsing experience
‚Ä¢ Compatible with modern Chrome browsers
‚Ä¢ Open-source development approach

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
‚Ä¢ This is a research tool, not a commercial product
‚Ä¢ Detection results are probabilistic, not definitive
‚Ä¢ Designed for educational and research purposes
‚Ä¢ No data monetization or third-party sharing

ü§ù Contributing to Research:
By using this extension, you're contributing to important research about AI content detection and social media authenticity. All data usage follows strict research ethics guidelines.

REQUIRED FORM FIELDS:
====================

Single Purpose Description (0/1,000 characters):
This extension automatically detects AI-generated "slop" content in Facebook posts as users scroll, helping users identify potentially artificial content through real-time analysis and visual indicators.

PERMISSION JUSTIFICATIONS (0/1,000 characters each):

activeTab justification:
Required to inject content scripts and analyze Facebook posts on the currently active tab when user visits Facebook pages.

scripting justification:
Needed to inject content analysis scripts into Facebook pages to detect and analyze post content for AI-generated patterns.

storage justification:
Used to store user preferences, analysis results cache, and extension configuration settings locally for improved performance.

tabs justification:
Required to monitor tab changes and ensure content analysis only runs on Facebook domains as specified in the manifest.

webRequest justification:
Needed to intercept and analyze network requests to the backend API for AI content detection without interfering with Facebook's functionality.

Host permission justification (for *://*.facebook.com/*):
Required to access and analyze Facebook post content in real-time as users scroll. The extension needs to inject content scripts, detect new posts, extract text content, and display AI detection results directly on Facebook pages.

REMOTE CODE USAGE:
Are you using remote code? YES, I am using remote code

Remote code justification:
The extension communicates with a backend API server to perform AI content analysis. Post content is sent to the remote server for machine learning-based detection of AI-generated text, and results are returned to display detection status to users.
